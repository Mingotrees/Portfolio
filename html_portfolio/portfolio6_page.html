                    <h1>Comparative Study On Different Types of Computers</h1>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Computers are defined to be electronic devices that can be programmed to accept, process, and store data according to a specific set of instructions. It performs a wide range of tasks that make everyday tasks more convenient and easier. Through the development of these computers, the world was able to connect despite being islands away from each other.</p>
                    <p>Looking back, computers were not the way they were before. It started from Engines, specifically, the Analytical Engine by Charles Babbage way back in the 1830s when its purpose was purely to make mathematical calculations. Over the years, it slowly grew to become more programmable, more modular, and more dynamic in terms of functions and purpose until such time that everybody had to have one computer system.</p>
                    <p>As technology continues to progress, computers get more and more better but it also gets a lot more expensive. For this reason, knowing what type of computer to use is essential in the modern way of living as it has become essential in most, if not all companies in the world. Therefore, knowing how the different parts of the system contribute to the performance of a computer will decide, and find the most suitable computer type for an individual’s needs.</p>
                    <p>This paper will discuss all the different types of computers, going in-depth into their components, their processing speeds, energy consumption, and where these computers are used in society in such a way that their full potential can be drawn out. Serves as a guide to what the different types of computers are capable of and in which places they fall short.</p>
                    <h2>Discussion</h2>
                    <p>To fully understand to which extent these computers can perform and what their capabilities are, we need to know how they differ in terms of components, parts, performance, and functionality. However, before that, we must first know the main types of these computers, which this section will cover. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Types of Computers (based on size)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text_special">SuperComputers
                            <p>considered to be the most powerful computers. It is capable of performing an estimate of trillions of calculations per second. These computers are utilized in the field of science, which incorporates complex computations such as weather forecasting.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li class="text_special">Mainframe Computers
                            <p>These are large-scale computers capable of handling vast amounts of data and supporting hundreds of users simultaneously. It is commonly used for bulk data processing in large organizations</p>

                            <p>Known as mid-range computers. Smaller than mainframes but larger than personal computers. Used for tasks that require multiple users such as industrial applications.</p>

                            <p>These are high-performance computers designed for technical or 
                                scientific tasks. They possess enhanced graphics capabilities and are commonly used in 
                                engineering and animation.

                    <p>Comparing these types of computers boils down to what their components and characteristics are and how those specific components and characteristics contribute to their performance. In this section, we specify some of these characteristics as the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>CPU
                            <p>The performance of the CPU is based on their clock speed, core count, and, architecture.  Higher clock speeds mean the CPU can perform more cycles per second. Multiple cores allow parallel processing improving multi-threading.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Memory
                            <p>Larger amounts of memory allow more applications to run simultaneously without slowing down the system.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Processing Speed
                            <p>refers to how quickly a computer can execute instructions. Determined by clock speeds and the efficiency of their architecture.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Calcuting Power
                            <p>a computer's ability to perform complex mathematical operations efficiently. This is often measured in Floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) or Million instructions per second (MIPS), which generally indicates how many floating-point arithmetic calculations can a computer complete in one second.</p>
                        </li>
