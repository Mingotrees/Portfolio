                    <h1>Comparative Study On Different Types of Computers</h1>
                    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Computers are defined to be electronic devices that can be programmed to accept, process, and store data according to a specific set of instructions. It performs a wide range of tasks that make everyday tasks more convenient and easier. Through the development of these computers, the world was able to connect despite being islands away from each other.</p>
                    <p>Looking back, computers were not the way they were before. It started from Engines, specifically, the Analytical Engine by Charles Babbage way back in the 1830s when its purpose was purely to make mathematical calculations. Over the years, it slowly grew to become more programmable, more modular, and more dynamic in terms of functions and purpose until such time that everybody had to have one computer system.</p>
                    <p>As technology continues to progress, computers get more and more better but it also gets a lot more expensive. For this reason, knowing what type of computer to use is essential in the modern way of living as it has become essential in most, if not all companies in the world. Therefore, knowing how the different parts of the system contribute to the performance of a computer will decide, and find the most suitable computer type for an individual’s needs.</p>
                    <p>This paper will discuss all the different types of computers, going in-depth into their components, their processing speeds, energy consumption, and where these computers are used in society in such a way that their full potential can be drawn out. Serves as a guide to what the different types of computers are capable of and in which places they fall short.</p>
                    <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
                    <p>To fully understand to which extent these computers can perform and what their capabilities are, we need to know how they differ in terms of components, parts, performance, and functionality. However, before that, we must first know the main types of these computers, which this section will cover.

                    </ul>
                    <p>Comparing these types of computers boils down to what their components and characteristics are and how those specific components and characteristics contribute to their performance. In this section, we specify some of these characteristics as the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>CPU
                            <p>The performance of the CPU is based on their clock speed, core count, and, architecture.  Higher clock speeds mean the CPU can perform more cycles per second. Multiple cores allow parallel processing improving multi-threading.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Memory
                            <p>Larger amounts of memory allow more applications to run simultaneously without slowing down the system.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Processing Speed
                            <p>refers to how quickly a computer can execute instructions. Determined by clock speeds and the efficiency of their architecture.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Calcuting Power
                            <p>a computer's ability to perform complex mathematical operations efficiently. This is often measured in Floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) or Million instructions per second (MIPS), which generally indicates how many floating-point arithmetic calculations can a computer complete in one second.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Working Principle
                            <p>involves fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, executing operations via the CPU, and storing them back in memory or storage.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Energy Consumption
                            <p>More powerful computers often consume more energy due to their high-performance components. Maintaining low power consumption while maintaining performance is a challenge for high-performance computers.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Field of Use
                            <p>determines which type of computer is most suitable for specific applications. Understanding this helps in selecting the right type of computer for different applications.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>In the context of CPUs, there is such thing we call “Processor Architectures”, they are fundamental designs that define how computers operate and interact with other components. It determines the instruction set, data processing capabilities, and overall performance of the processor.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Types of Processor Architecture</h3>
                    <h4>RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computer)</h4>
                    <li style="font-weight: normal;">Designed for efficiency, enabling higher performance with lower power consumption.</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: normal;">Ideal for mobile devices</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: normal;">Example: ARM(Advance Risc Machines) processor</li>
                    <h4>C(Complex Instruction Set Computer)</h4>
                    <li style="font-weight: normal;">Designed for more powerful processing capabilities, with generally higher power consumption as it requires more cycles to execute instructions.</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: normal;">Example: x86 Architecture</li>
                    <p>After, specifying the characteristics and components we have to look into, we can now apply it to compare the different types of computers. The information will be placed on the table below:</p>

                    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>As shown in the table below, supercomputers possess the greatest capabilities in all aspects, which is the main reason why it is used in very important applications like weather forecasting or nuclear tests. Mainframes come second to processing, calculating, and other capabilities as shown in the table. Mainframes are the ones powering the industry's main infrastructures and businesses like banks.</p>
                    <p>If we dive down to the, commonly used computers in the lower level of computations, these are Micro Computers, Mini Computers, Workstations, and Servers, we can see that in terms of:</p>
                    <img src="/ppt_files/port6_assets/figure-9.png">
                    <p>Therefore, when buying new computer systems, an individual who wants high-end specifications needs to consider the processing speeds, memory capacity, and even the power consumption as it can really increase the electricity bill of one’s household or business costs.                    </p>
