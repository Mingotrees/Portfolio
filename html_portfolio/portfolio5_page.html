                <h1>Comparative Study On Different Types Of Motherboards</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Referred to as the “backbone” or “spine” of the computer, the motherboard or also referred to as a “Printed Circuit Board” serves as the link between different hardware components such as processors, graphic cards, etc. Being the “spine” of a computer, it is the largest component visible in a computer system. The central processing unit or simply CPU is often called the computer’s brain but not many people, know that the motherboard is also considered as such. The motherboard supports the BIOS or the Basic Input Output System initializing the computer’s firmware, hardware, and software, making it one of the brains. 
                </p>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Before motherboards were invented, backplanes were used instead. Backplanes were generally the same as motherboards, except they lacked processing or storage elements. Their purpose was generally just to connect different devices together.
                </p>
                <p>The first backplane to qualify as a motherboard according to Volle (2023) on his article in the history of motherboards, was the Planar Breadboard, designed by an IBM engineer Patty McHugh. This was during the 1980s and was used in the 1981 IBM Personal Computer.
                </p>
                <p>The 1980s and 1990s were the years when motherboard design was very progressive due to the demand for performance and the goal to make the components present in the motherboard smaller. The introduction of advanced-technology (AT) and advanced-technology extended (ATX) standardized motherboard dimensions and mounting points, making it compatible across different computer cases and components. </p>
                <p>In the 21st century, the introduction of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and other advanced technologies into motherboards has greatly improved and redefined the capabilities of motherboards.
                </p>
                <p>As years go by, parts get smaller and performance has been rapidly advancing within these motherboards and hardware components, generating new possibilities within the computing world. In addition, researchers address issues regarding electronic waste and innovators look into the future with performance and sustainability in mind.
                </p>
                <h2>Discussion</h2>
                <p>To further understand how a motherboard connects other hardware components together, we first look at its parts.</p>

                <img src ="/ppt_files/port5_assets/figure-2.png">
                <p>The different types of motherboard mainly depends on their sizes EATX or Extended-ATX being the largest and Pico-ITX being the smallest. Few details also change with their form factors such as expandability and built-in features, giving a wide variety of choices for users depending on their needs and use cases.
                </p>

                        </ul>
                        <ul>Disadvantage
                            <li>Limited expansion capabilites</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>E-ATX
                        <p>these are designed to extend the standard ATX form measuring 30.48 x 33.02 cm. It features multi-GPU set ups and include a higher RAM capacity.</p>
                        <ul>Advantages
                            <li>Excellent for high-end builds.</li>

                        <ul>Disadvantage
                            <li>Expensive and needs full tower case.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>There are many other different types that exists, and they are usually smaller than the E-ATX motherboard. Some of these form factors include NANO-ITX and PICO-ITX which are very small motherboards catering to ultra compact devices and specialized applications, such as digital signage and IoT devices.
